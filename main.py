These issues can include:\n\nNot being able to connect to the data server\nThe data server not being able to connect to the coordinator\nThe data server not having the correct data\n\nQ: What is Druid?\nA: Druid is a data store that is used to store data for analysis.\n\nQ: What is the square root of banana?\nA: Unknown\n\nQ: What are the benefits of columnar storage?\nA: Columnar storage formats are highly optimized for linear scans, meaning that they can quickly scan through all the data in a column. This makes them a good choice for analytics applications.\n\nQ: Why doesn't Druid support JOINs?\nA: Druid doesn't support JOINs because they can be expensive and can slow down your queries.\n\nQ: How many squigs are in a bonk?\nA: Unknown" + question,
